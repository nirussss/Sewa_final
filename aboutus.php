                <h2>WHY CHOOSE SEWA?</h2>
                <p>
                    Sewa is a cloth donation website designed to facilitate the donation of gently used clothing to those in need.
                    People can request any kind of help for clothes through this website. This website also plays a vital role in developing 
                    a sense of volunteering and promoting good deeds. The core aim of "Sewa" is to simplify the donation process, making it 
                    accessible to anyone with the desire to help. This platform helps donors who want to donate different clothing items 
                    but face challenges due to busy schedules and a lack of convenient and trustworthy donation channels. "Sewa" encourages 
                    more individuals to participate in charitable acts, thereby amplifying the collective impact on society.
